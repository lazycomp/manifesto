**Smart Lazy** is a gathering of smart lazy developers.

## Our values

- Coordinate with fellow peers with dignity and mutual respect. Be kind, nobody is all-knowing, not us for sure, and not even you.
- When suggesting, designing and implementing things, always have the end-user's perspective and interest in mind. If it's a library, then the end user is a developer, but it's still an end user.
- Take a shortcut and you save a little time now but waste a lot of time in the future (refactoring, upgrading, realising you've missed design decisions which now lead to breaking changes, etc.). Don't do that. Be SMART lazy, work a bit more now to save more time later.
- Regularly maintain crystal clear docs and roadmap. No, it's not a waste of time.
- HAVE FUN ;)
