**Smart Lazy** is a gathering of smart lazy developers.

## Our values

- Coordinate with fellow peers with dignity and mutual respect. Be kind, nobody is all-knowing, not us for sure, and not even you.
- When suggesting, designing and implementing things, always have the end-user's perspective and interest in mind.
- Do your best now, or later you'll have more work to do. But don't necessarily do more than is required. Be smart lazy.
- Maintain a clear design and roadmap. System architecture decisions must be well argumented and timed.
- HAVE FUN :)
