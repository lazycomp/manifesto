This is a living document, as well as the entire organisation. Everything is evolving and so are we.

Members and contributor rules aply to product repos. This repo for instance is privately maintained by selected members. Exploratory repos are tagged accordingly, and their status is mentioned in the readme.

## Organisation values

- Think like an end-user, implement like a software architect.
- Design exhaustively. Things left out intentionally should be mentioned.
- Coordinate with fellow peers with dignity and mutual respect.
- Do your best.
- Be kind.
- Have FUN!
- want more? adhere and add here :)

## Contributor rules

- Reporting issues: please search for a similar issue and comment / ask to reopen (if applicable) before creating a new issue.
- Pull requests are more than welcome!
- When contributing, make sure you follow the coding styles defined in the project for each programming language.
- Include unit tests unless otherwise specified or when they don't make sense (motivate lack of tests if necessary).

## Member rules

- Members never commit/push directly to a public project's repo. They work on their forks and submit pull requests.
- Complete pull request policy will be defined in another document (link it here afterwards)

## Official repos

- Must have at least two active members with push permissions.
- Must contain coding style definitions like `.eslintrc` for most used languages
