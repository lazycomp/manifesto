**Lazy Comp** is a bunch of smart lazy developers.

## Our values

- Coordinate with fellow peers with dignity and mutual respect. Be kind, nobody is all-knowing, not us for sure, and not even you.
- When suggesting features or options, and when designing and implementing things, always have the end-user's perspective in mind.
- Do your best now, or later you'll have more work to do. Be smart lazy.
- Clear design and roadmap. Architecture decisions must be well argumented and timed.
- Have FUN!
