This is a living document, as well as the entire organisation. Everything is evolving and so are we.

## Organisation values

- Think like an end-user, implement like a software architect.
- Design exhaustively. Things left out intentionally should be mentioned.
- Coordinate with fellow peers with dignity and mutual respect.
- Do your best.
- Be kind.
- Have FUN!
- want more? adhere and add here :)

## Contributor rules

- Reporting issues: please search for a similar issue and comment / ask to reopen (if applicable) before creating a new issue.
- Pull requests are more than welcome!
- When contributing, make sure you follow the coding styles defined in the project for each programming language.
- Include unit tests unless otherwise specified or when they don't make sense (motivate lack of tests if necessary).

## Member rules

- Members never commit/push directly to a public project's repo. They work on their forks and submit pull requests.
- Complete pull request policy will be defined in another document (link it here afterwards)

## Official repos

- Must have at least two active members with push permissions.
- Must contain coding style definitions like `.eslintrc` for most used languages
