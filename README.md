**Smart Lazy** is a gathering of smart lazy developers.

## Our values

- Coordinate with fellow peers with dignity and mutual respect. Be kind, nobody is all-knowing, not us for sure, and not even you.
- When suggesting, designing and implementing things, always have the end-user's perspective and interest in mind.
- Plan ahead and implement things thoroughly, including improbable contingencies but at the limit of overdoing it. This will make life easier for you and others. Be smart lazy.
- Maintain a clear design and roadmap. System architecture decisions must be well argumented and timed.
- HAVE FUN ;)
